**Marlowe 2025** 

This is one of a set of proposals that together consolidate the Marlowe infrastructure and improve the developer experience, enhance Marlowe with an innovative oracle protocol, developed in collaboration with leading Cardano oracle providers, and design the successor core language, Marlowe V2, working with the Marlowe developer ecosystem.

**Increasing Oracle’s Accessibility on Cardano**

The current oracle systems on Cardano operate predominantly on a fixed, push-based model, which limits the ability to meet diverse and less commonly used data needs for smart contracts. Our solution, the Marlowe Oracle Protocol, aims to solve this by shifting towards a pull-based model, where oracles respond dynamically to on-chain data requests, ensuring better adaptability and data coverage for a wider array of contracts.

Our approach is centered around enhancing flexibility, transparency, and simplicity. We want to make the process of using oracles in smart contracts much more accessible to developers, whether they are experienced with Cardano tools or are just getting started with Marlowe, Aiken, or PlutusTx. The protocol will also include user-friendly tools, developed in TypeScript, Rust, and Haskell, to facilitate oracle accessibility for the end users and simplify integrations for developers as well as data providers.

**Marlowe Oracle Specification**

We want to formalize the “Marlowe Oracle Protocol” and submit it as a detailed Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP). There are no guarantees that the proposal will be accepted but the process itself will allow us to approach the problem in a systematic manner and to create concise specifications.

**Collaborations with Oracle Providers**

To ensure the success and adoption of the Marlowe Oracle Protocol we are collaborating with key partners in the Cardano ecosystem:

* **Wolfram Blockchain Labs**: We are working pretty closely with the Team already and they are in the process of deploying their oracle solution on the mainnet and are really open to integrate the new approach into their future product release.  
* **Charli3 Oracles:** We already initiated discussions with Charlie3, and they expressed interest in our proposal and future integrations.  
* **Other oracle providers**: We have spoken to other providers, including Orcfax and we hope to work closely with them on this project.

**Marlowe Runtime and TS-SDK Adaptations**

We will enhance the Marlowe Runtime to better support the Marlowe Oracle Protocol. This adaptation will include more precise “merkleization splitting” so developers are able to specify division points which preserve semantically meaningful subcontracts from the oracle perspective. This capability will be also exposed in our TypeScript SDK and examples.

**Data Providers Toolkit**

**Ready To Use Oracle Service**

We will expand on our oracle CLI application, which is currently a basic request harvester and data provider, transforming it into a fully operational, standalone system service. This minimal but complete implementation will serve as an MVP for the Marlowe Oracle Protocol. The goal is to deliver an out-of-the-box solution that requires minimal configuration, enabling oracle operators to start providing data points using the new emerging standard.

**Customizable TypeScript Example and SDK**

Additionally we will create standalone TypeScript examples which will demonstrate to the oracle builders how to discover and respond to the data point requests on the chain. These examples should be easy to customize and integrate with existing systems and complementary to the 


<!--
Other possible parts of the solution:

1. Data points verifier example:

The new standard should cover some form of metadata distribution which explain to the end user what is the semantic of a particular Oracle request and which Oracle is responsible for delivering the answer.
We could propose some transport agnostic simple query protocol: hash of the data point \-\> certified response with metadata. The metadata format should be rather simple but extensible. At a minimum it could be a human readable description with internationalization support.  
Pretty natural implementation of this particular protocol could be a pretty simple HTTP service.
Should we provide an example of such a service as well?

2. Betting DApp example - in the previous proposal we included an example which was part of the Starter Kit.

### \[IMPACT\] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community

Please include here a description of how you intend to measure impact (whether quantitative or qualitative) and how and with whom you will share your outputs:

* In what way will the success of your project bring value to the Cardano Community?   
* How will you measure this impact?   
* How will you share the outputs and opportunities that result from your project?

**Answer: \***  
The Marlowe Oracle Protocol is a key enabler that will significantly lower barriers for both developers and data providers within the Cardano ecosystem. Marlowe already simplifies blockchain technology adoption for new users by providing an intuitive domain-specific language for financial contracts. With the addition of Oracle Protocols, we are expanding this accessibility to a wider range of real-world applications.

**Lowering Entry Barriers for Developers**

By devloping and integrating the Marlowe Oracle Protocol into the Marlowe Runtime, we empower developers to not only create financial contracts but also seamlessly include oracle-based functionalities, which are critical for DeFi and other blockchain-powered use cases. Developers can now:

* Easily access real-world data in a secure, transparent, and trustless manner.  
* Utilize easy-to-integrate tools and examples within our TypeScript SDK (TS-SDK), allowing them to quickly build dApps that harness external data.
* Implement Oracle requests in their contracts through straightforward integration, opening new possibilities for data-driven dApps.

**Lowering Entry Barriers for Data Providers**

The Marlowe Oracle Protocol also provides a clear pathway for data providers, such as stake pool operators (SPOs) or other trusted entities, to start contributing to the Cardano ecosystem with minimal overhead. We will deliver a lightweight but fully functional Oracle software component that implements the new protocol. This system is designed for:

* Ease of Deployment: Data providers can quickly set up and deploy this Oracle software integrating it with their knowledge backends.
* Reach and Incentives: With Marlowe's expanding ecosystem, Oracle data providers will gain direct access to a growing pool of developers and dApps that need data for their contracts. This creates a strong incentive model, where providers can monetize data sharing in a transparent and standardized manner.

**DeFi Expansion**
The ability to incorporate real-world data into contracts expands Marlowe’s potential use cases in the DeFi space, allowing for more sophisticated financial products and growth of the whole Cardano DeFi ecosystem.

**Infrastructure Growth**
Oracle services built with our protocol will help establish a foundational layer of real-world data access, which is crucial for many applications. The integration and standardization of Oracles will lead to an increase in robust and reliable infrastructure that dApp developers can depend on.

### \[RESOURCES\] Who is in the project team and what are their roles?

List your team, their Linkedin profiles (or similar) and state what aspect of the proposal’s work each team member will undertake.

If you are planning to recruit additional team members, please state what specific skills you will be looking for in the people you recruit, so readers can see that you understand what skills will be needed to complete the project.

You are expected to have already engaged the relevant members of the organizations referenced so you understand if they are willing and/or have capacity to support the project. If you have not taken any steps to engage with your team yet, it is likely that the resources will not be available if you are approved for funding, which can jeopardize the project before it has even begun. The Catalyst team cannot help with this, meaning you are expected to have understood the requirements and engaged the necessary people before submitting a proposal.

Have you engaged anyone on any of the technical group channels (eg Discord or Telegram), or do you have a direct line of communications with the people and resources required?  
Important: Catalyst funding is not anonymous, and some level of ‘proof of life’ verifications will take place before initial funding is released. Also remember that your proposal will be publicly available, so make sure to obtain any consent required before including confidential or third party information.

All Project Participants must disclose their role and scope of services across any submitted proposals, even if they are not in the lead or co-proposer role, such as an implementer, vendor, service provider, etc. Failure to disclose this information may lead to disqualification from the current grant round.  
**Answer: \***

Simon Thompson, who is one of the inventors of Marlowe, will coordinate the project, and will act as an “internal customer” for the technologies developed, giving guidance on their functionality and interfaces, as well as acting as writer/presenter of materials within the DSK (Marlowe DApp Starter Kit). 

Tomasz Rybarczyk and Nicolas Henin, who have jointly worked on the Marlowe team for NNN years, will act as Full Stack Engineers and will develop the proposal feature set. The work content has been carefully structured and estimated for two full time engineers proficient in Marlowe technology. 

The Marlowe Special Interest Groups will challenge and openly discuss Proposal Implementation details and we’ll eventually include new contributors in the marlowe-lang github organization.

### \[BUDGET & COSTS\] Please provide a cost breakdown of the proposed work and resources

Make sure every element mentioned in your plan reflects its cost. It may be helpful to refer to your plan and timeline, list all the resources you will need at each stage, and what they cost.

Here, provide a clear description of any third party product or service you will be using. This could be hardware, software licenses, professional services (legal, accounting, code auditing, etc) but does not need to include the use of contracted programmers and developers.

The exact budget elements you include will depend on what type of work you are doing, and you might need to give less detail for a small, low-budget proposal. If the cost of the project will exceed the funding request, please provide information about alternative sources of funding.

Consider including budget elements for publicity / marketing / promotion / community engagement; project management; documentation; and reporting back to the community. Most proposals need these, but many proposers forget to include them.

### \[VALUE FOR MONEY\] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?

Use the response to provide the context about the costs you listed previously, particularly if they are high.

It may be helpful to include some brief information on how you have decided on the costs of the project.

For instance, can you justify with supporting evidence that costs are proportional to the average wage in your country, or typical freelance rates in your industry? Is there anything else that helps to support how the project represents value for money?

Marlowe is a key technology for Cardano; this proposal maintains its current capabilities for the community, and supports the projects that depend on it. This provides value for all the projects that depend on the continued availability of Marlowe on Cardano, through bug fixes, Plutus upgrades and Hard Forks.

Our costings are based on prevailing rates for developers in Europe, and we are charging the same rate for all contributors. We have the right combination of skills available through a combination of full- and part-time contributions. The team proposed is highly experienced having previously worked as members of the core Marlowe team; there is therefore no time needed for the team to get up to speed: we hit the ground running.
